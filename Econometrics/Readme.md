#### The pdf files are the final project summary papers.

Econometrics_Project_1 -- In this project we analyzed and predicted a portfolio of three of each of the three team members’ favorite stocks (NFLX, NVDA, FB, SQ, SHOP, RHT, Z, TXN, MTCH). For our data source, we used the R library “quantmod”. Quantmod is a quantitative financial modelling framework used to specify, build, trade, and analyze stock prices and other financial trading strategies. For the purposes of our project, we only used this library to fetch the daily open, close, high, and low prices for the last two years.

Econometrics_Project_2_Final -- In this project, we analyzed a portfolio of diverse securities. The team fit, back-tested, and forecasted the returns of the portfolio with ARIMA and GARCH models. Additionally, we used an efficient frontier technique to optimize our portfolio to get the best expected returns for our level of risk. We compared the root squared mean error (RMSE) of the forecasts from both models of our portfolio over the last 5 days of returns to analyze which model performed better.
