# Featured Projects  
  
### Hand Washing Analysis using data from Dr. Semmelweis in the 1840s  
  - This is a small project that uses pandas plot to show the effects of deaths after giving birth of two different clinics before and after hand-washing. Bootstrapping is also used to create a 95% confidence interval on the difference on the proportion of deaths before and after hand-washing.  
  
### Exploring 67 years of LEGO toys    
  - This is a very small project that explores different Lego toys using groupby, aggregation, and pandas plot.  
  
### Moby Dick Word Frequency Analysis  
  - This is a small project that shows how to use basic functioning web-scraping tools 'request' and BeautifulSoup to extract the text of the book Moby Dick in order to use the Natural Language ToolKit to find the frequency of words used in the text.  
  
### Reducing Traffic Mortality  
  - This is a small project involving traffic fatality data from the US that shows how to use basic data visualization packages along with some pre-processing functions in sklearn to make a recommendation using basic KMeans clustering. Some pre-processing functions used: StandardScaler() to standardize the data and PCA() to transform the data into principal components. KMeans() clustering was also used. A scree plot was generated to find the optimal number of clusters and violin plots were made to the features of the different clusters in order to help make a recommendation about where to focus fatality mitigation efforts.
